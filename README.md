# 💊 PillApp (initial prototype name)

This project began in January 2024, initially created as a medication reminder app. Later, I found it necessary to extend its functionality to other applications and uses in similar products that are part of everyday life, such as sports supplements and cream applications.

The app is currently in development and is fully focused on health. It includes sports tracking and uses geolocation to measure distances traveled. The development tools used are Expo React Native, Firebase, and Expo Notifications, and it incorporates some Kotlin code for creating native Android widgets by ejecting the project.

This public repository is where I post updates about the project, upload screenshots, and share parts of the code that I consider public, such as components, functions, assets, etc.
